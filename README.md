# Bolt
> I tried coding a programming language not once, but twice. And failed both times. Hoping this one is different! I've been working hard at this for just over a last week.

An easy to read, compiled, whitespace independent, multi-paradigm statically and strongly typed language with type inference and null saftey.

> The Bolt compiler is split into many different parts, the furthest in being the least done.
> 1. File Reader
> 2. Lexer
> 3. Parser
> 4. Inferrer
> 5. LLVM Code Generator
> 6. Machine Code
> 7. Run Code
